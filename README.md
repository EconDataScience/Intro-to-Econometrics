# Intro-to-Econometrics
A first-day activity I created for an intro to econometrics class (undergraduate level). This activity conducts the same sequence of steps in R and Stata for comparison.

RStataReview.pdf presents the sequence of steps and relevant technical information about R and Stata. 
RStataReview.tex is the latex file used to generate this report. 

firstclass.r and firstclass.do are the R and Stata (respectively) scripts for the activity. 
mroz.csv is the dataset used for the activity.
